Assumptions
- Each meter produces one file per day
- Each meter file can only have a single reading type
- FlowDirection of 1 means supplying to the net, 0 means subtracting
- A positive price means partner receives money, a negative prices means he has to pay
- The IntervalReadings can intersect, be disjointed or joining due to whatever reasons
- The specified unit price matches the unit type
- Timestamps are supplied in UTC

Design choices:
- Use BigDecimal for prices for extra precision, as small differences can add up.
- Keep all timestamps in UTC, use ZonedDateTime whenever possible
- A flexible IntervalReading parser to accommodate for imperfect readings
